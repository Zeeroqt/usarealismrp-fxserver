Wow! You actually clicked on the read me file! You are awesome!
To start off I would like to thank you for buying the script! I really do apricate it!

# Slash Tire

## About
Slash Tires is a standalone script that allows players to slash the tires of vehicles. 
It is highly configurable which allows you to configure it to your needs and wants, including the disabled slashing of tires on emergency or/and specified vehicle models.
Additionally, it uses fivem's inbuilt key mapping system to allow players to customize their key binds, both for keyboard and controllers. 
Furthermore, it supports both qTarget and qb-target if enabled in the config file. It also has server-sided checks to prevent abuse (because fuck cheaters), 
and can easily be translated to other languages if you so desire. On top of all of this, you can freely edit the source code to your heart's content.

I have been testing the script for quite a while, so there shouldn't be any bugs or problems. However, if you find any bugs, report them and I'll fix them ASAP!
